["From: Mamatha Devineni Ratnam <mr47+@andrew.cmu.edu>\nSubject: Pens fans reactions\nOrganization: Post Office, Carnegie
Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\nLines: 12\nNNTP-Posting-Host: po4.andrew.cmu.edu\n\n\n\nI am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty
confused about the lack\nof any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit
relieved. However, I am going to put an end\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\nare killing those
Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\nfo fun to watch
in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of
Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\nregular season game. PENS RULE!!!\n\n", 'From:
